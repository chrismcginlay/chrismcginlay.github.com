I created and shared a set of summary notes after the course.\r\n* [Summary Notes, by C. McGinlay](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1jesnYtfsVsnNPA3rSwmMC6vEh3k-F099b9tCD0UTl_I)\r\n* [CS259 Software Debugging by Andreas Zeller and Gundega Dekena](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs259)\r\n\r\n###Microcontrollers and Robotics\r\nTo date I have worked exclusively with the [Arduino UNO](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) micro-controller. Language is [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/), C++ based. Projects brought to operational stage have included:\r\n* Line following buggy.

It covered techniques in data mining, pattern recognition, classification etc; with supervised and unsupervised techniques including SVMs, neural networks, clustering, recommender systems, map-reduce and dimensionality reduction. Coverage was both theoretical and practical, for the latter using the Octave language (numerical computation language similar to Matlab).\r\n\r\n* https://www.coursera.org/course/ml\r\n\r\n###Kaggle.com\r\nAfter completing the Coursera.org machine learning course (see above), I entered two world-wide machine learning competitions on Kaggle.com. I chose Python for these competitions, and used [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning library for the SVM.\r\n* \"Don't Get Kicked!\" Optimised logistic regression.\r\n* \"Bioresponse\" Partially optimised Support Vector Machine. \r\n* [Kaggle Profile](http://www.kaggle.com/users/26471/grunthus#profile-results)\r\n\r\n###Blender 3D Course Development\r\nI have developed a course for teaching Blender 3D (www.blender.org) to complete novice students. The course already covers the basic concepts, with staged exemplar blend files. As to whether or not the course is complete - it's an introduction; some of the later sections are sketchy. Overall it could do with some more exemplar files too. If you want to join me on adding to this project, please contact me (link to G+ below)\r\n* [Blender Intro](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B_5Czrc-P3APWHZCN24wdWlDdlk/edit)\r\n\r\n\r\n###Lean Launchpad - Eduduck\r\nIn October 2012, I completed a business startup course, given by [Steve Blank](http://steveblank.com/) and hosted on Udacity.com. This explored the fundamental differences between a Startup company and an established company, defining the essential activity of a Startup as a **search** for a repeatable business model. This was a hands-on course; it involved speaking to members of the public to test ideas. Everything was backed up with formal analysis. Really enjoyable delivery by Steve Blank, full of enthusiasm, totally recommendable to _anyone_.\r\n* [EP245 How to Build a Startup](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/ep245/CourseRev/1).\r\n* [Business Model Generation](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas) - technique used.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the course, I have continued to research an online education business model, with the working title of 'EduDuck'. The code hosted in a private repository on github via @mrintegrity. \r\n* [EduDuck](www.eduduck.com) Business Model Canvas exploration.\r\n\r\n###Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n* I play chess via Chess Time [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haptic.chesstime&hl=en) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chess-time-multiplayer-game/id455602152?mt=8) My username is ChrisMc\r\n* Visit my [Google+](https://plus.google.com/110075889815392203358/about) profile.\r\n\r\n","name":"Chris McGinlay","tagline":"Python, Django, microcontrollers, machine learning."}
