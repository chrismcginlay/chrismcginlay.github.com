I created and shared a set of summary notes after the course.\r\n* [Summary Notes, by C. McGinlay](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1jesnYtfsVsnNPA3rSwmMC6vEh3k-F099b9tCD0UTl_I)\r\n* [CS259 Software Debugging by Andreas Zeller and Gundega Dekena](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs259)\r\n\r\n###Microcontrollers and Robotics\r\n###Machine Learning\r\nAt the end of 2011, I completed a coursera.org course \"Machine Learning\", given by Stanford's Professor Andrew Ng.  It covered techniques in data mining, pattern recognition, classification etc; with supervised and unsupervised techniques including SVMs, neural networks, clustering, recommender systems, map-reduce and dimensionality reduction. Coverage was both theoretical and practical, for the latter using the Octave language (numerical computation language similar to Matlab).\r\n\r\nhttps://www.coursera.org/course/ml\r\n\r\n###Kaggle.com\r\nAfter completing the Coursera.org machine learning course (see above), I entered two world-wide machine learning competitions on Kaggle.com. \r\n*\"Don't Get Kicked!\". Finished in top 11%. Optimised logistic regression.\r\n*\"Bioresponse\". Partially optimised Support Vector Machine. Above average score.\r\n* [Kaggle Profile](http://www.kaggle.com/users/26471/grunthus#profile-results)\r\n\r\n###Blender 3D Course Development\r\n###Lean Launchpad - Eduduck\r\n###Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
